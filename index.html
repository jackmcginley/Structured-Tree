        <h1>Structured tree object</h1>

       <p> The  tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a  structure in a graphical form.   The tree is drawn with the root at the top, with multiple branches below.  </p>
       <p> Each item in the tree is called a 'node' and is assigned a node number.  In the example below, the node numbers are shown on the diagram.  The parent node is the node immediately above the node in the tree. Each node can have one or more 'child' nodes, for example node 013 in the diagram has 3 children - 0131, 0132 and 0133.</p>
       <p>In this simple example, if you mouse over any node in the diagram, it will highlight all the 'ancestors' of that node all  the way up the tree to the root node.  Give  it a try!</p>

      <h2>Now build your own tree.</h2>
      <p>You can construct a tree by adding nodes in the hierarchy below the root node</p>
      <p>To get started, decide what you would like the tree to represent.  Examples could be the structure of books in a library (fiction and non-fiction; then romance, thrillers, sci-fi under fiction etc);  or college courses (arts, sciences, engineering with further branches below each category), or world - continents - countries - cities etc.</p>
      <p>In the field below, enter a simple heading that will become the root of your tree (such as 'Library' or 'Courses' as in the examples above).</p>
      <p>After creating the  root, you can click on any node to add a child node.</p>
